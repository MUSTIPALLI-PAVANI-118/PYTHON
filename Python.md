 Features of Python
🔹 Simple and Readable

Syntax is close to English

Easy for beginners

print("Welcome to Python")

🔹 Interpreted Language

Code is executed line by line

No need for compilation

🔹 Platform Independent

Same code runs on Windows, Linux, macOS

🔹 Dynamically Typed

No need to declare data types

x = 10
x = "Python"

🔹 Object-Oriented

Python Syntax (Basic Program Structure)
🔹 Simple Python Program
print("Hello, World!")

🔹 Important Syntax Rules

Python uses indentation instead of braces { }

Indentation shows block of code

Usually 4 spaces are used

if True:
    print("This is indented")


❌ Wrong indentation causes IndentationError
Supports classes and objects

🔹 Large Standard Library

Built-in modules like math, sys, os
